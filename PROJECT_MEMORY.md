# Project Memory

This is the durable record of design decisions made in collaboration. It is
updated after project-relevant user conversations; it intentionally stores
summaries, not private or verbatim chat transcripts.

## 2026-08-02 — Novel pacing and long-form direction

- The user wants the game to read like a slow-paced fantasy novel, with context
  and NPC introduction before urgent choices.
- Desired tonal palette: fantasy adventure, love, revenge, redemption,
  suspense/thriller, drama, fiction, and consequential gore.
- Long-term ambition is 1,000+ hours of replayable play and approximately
  10,000 pages of authored/variant narrative. Build this through event arcs,
  relationship routes, legacy variation, and reusable scene systems—not one
  linear mandatory script.
- Added `npc_dialogue_and_routes.txt` as the authoring reference for voice,
  feelings, slow-burn routes, and novel-pacing rules.
- Added Old Hendrik roadside scenes between every origin opening and the
  caravan/ruin path, so the Harvest Failure has human context before Mira
  Talbot asks for help.
- Future content must update this file when it changes a design decision or
  implementation sequence.

## 2026-08-02 — Legacy and first event implementation

- The Story & Systems Bible contains a formal Living Legend / Retired Hero
  design. It is documented but not yet implemented in Dart.
- Events 0 (Harvest Failure) and 1 (Salt Road Rebellion) are playable.
- Event 2 is currently only foreshadowed at the Event 1 coda and needs authoring
  before the campaign can continue.
